Sample SOP and Article

## Sample SOP
I am passionate about Electric and Hybrid vehicles. Mainly I am interested in Battery Pack Design and Power Electronics.

BMS is a crucial aspect of the Battery Pack in which I want to learn how to develop algorithms for SOC, SOH, and Range estimation. I want to explore the electrical design of the pack and find answers to the questions, such as, What significant role does Machine learning can play in accurate range estimation, how we compensate for measurement inaccuracies of hardware in algorithms, etc. 

In Power electronics, I want to explore different feedback control mechanisms from control theory in power converters. I want to learn how to design these converters for given specifications using Lt Spice and MATLAB/Simulink tools.
 
Since I am still exploring Evs and HEV's, I welcome a learning opportunity that may kindle my interest in other electric power drive components.

Notice up till now, the author has expressed his interest in the internship, his ideas what he wants to do, not about 
the work he has done uptill now.
```

I have read some books and have done some courses on BMS, Power Electronics and EV's from Coursera and NPTEL. I have been an xxxxxx member of the Student Project, xxxxxx, which do xxxxxx. These have helped me in laying a strong foundation of fundamentals. I want to get my hands dirty on real-world problems by contributing with my dedication and experience. I wish to grow my knowledge in these domains, and I believe that this prestigious internship will help me achieve that.

The last paragraph of the SOP tries to summarize what he wants to achieve from the internhsip as well as what steps he 
has already taken to learn about electric vehicles. This proves his concrete interest towards the topic Also note that 
he has not told his experience in detail. What author feels is that is not the purpose of SOP, that is what resumes 
and CV's are for.
